        notes: 'Vulnerability research in 2023 has been laser focused solely on <b>Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)</b> tools. RMM tools fascinate me, as when they are compromised an attacker\'s scope grows exponentially from one compromised server to the potential compromise of every \'agent\' which is managed by the RMM server. I set myself a stretch goal this year to register 1 CVE per month, and I\'m proud to say that that goal has been thoroughly obliterated. I have a few interesting (IMO) observations from my research this year, and I\'m planning on delivering a conference talk in 2024 which discusses the state of this product domain.',
